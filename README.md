To make sure everything works as intended:

* Create and activate an environment using virtualenv.

```bash
virtualenv shielded-learning
source shielded-learning/bin/activate
```

* Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/safe-rl/safe-rl-shielding.git
```
* Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* There is a README file in each environment in the env directory that explains how each example can be run.
